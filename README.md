# A Web Based file explorer in Spring Boot
This is a schoolproject meant to demonstrate our ability to in a short period of time (48hrs) allow us to create something we haven't used before. My choice was Spring Boot (for the API) & a NextJS frontend.

## What features does this API have?
- The ability to create, modify & view files.
- Renaming them
- Deleting files

## How do I run this?
You need the following 2 repositories cloned:
- imadofficial/spring-boot **(You're here currently)**
- imadofficial/web-file-manager

Then, you open the `src/main/java/org/imadsnetwork
/fsmgnt/FsManagementApplication.java` binary to start the API.

Now you're up & running; go to the `web-file-manager` repository to follow the guide on how to run the website.
