# A Web Based file explorer in Spring Boot
This is a schoolproject meant to demonstrate our ability to in a short period of time (48hrs) allow us to create something we haven't used before. My choice was Spring Boot (for the API) & a NextJS frontend.

## How do I run this?
There are 2 repositories available:
    - imadofficial/spring-boot
    - imadofficial/web-file-manager

You need these 2 repositories cloned to be able to run it.
